#Logistal

This is a small program (in Matlab) that demonstrates a recurrence relation form
of the logistical function ![Logistical Equation](https://github.com/n6151h/logistal/eqn1.gif).

This produces plots like these, showing where (for what values of *r*) the recursion is stable

![Basic Logistical Function - Stable](https://github.com/n6151h/logistal/stable.png)

where it becomes unstable (see curve has gone from green to red)

Controls are provided to turn on cobweb plots (showing the recursion) and the underlying
function-calling-function:
