#Logistal

This is a small program (in Matlab) that demonstrates a recurrence relation form
of the logistical function:

This produces plots like these, showing where (for what values of *r*) the recursion is stable

where it becomes unstable (see curve has gone from green to red)

Controls are provided to turn on cobweb plots (showing the recursion) and the convergence (when stable) or
limit cycle behaviour (when unstable) of the underlying
function-calling-function:
